            <section class="blog-content">
                <p id="intro">Randomness is a fundamental concept in video games, used to create dynamic and exciting
                    experiences.
                    From the generation of dungeons in The Binding of Isaac to the natures of Pokemon, the rewards of
                    Monster Hunter quests or the player you get on a FIFA "chest", we have a wide range of options
                    for you to choose from.
                </p>
                <p>However, in programming, true randomness doesn't exist, since computers generate pseudorandom
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>This article explores how randomness affects the gameplay experience, from critical hits in RPGs to
                    level
                    generation and loot systems.</p>

                <hr class="left-hr">

                <h3 id="definition" class="anchor">1. What is Randomness in Programming?</h3>
                <p>In programming, pseudorandom numbers are generated using algorithms that rely on a
                    <strong>seed</strong> as a starting point. Although the numbers may appear random to the user, they
                    are completely deterministic.
                    This stands in contrast to <em>true randomness</em>, which is theoretical, unpredictable, and cannot
                    be reproduced within a computational environment.
                </p>

                <p>In other words, even though we call it "random generation," it's not truly random.
                    When a computer is asked to generate a random number or sequence, it uses a seed (essentially a
                    starting value or key) to produce a predictable sequence of numbers.</p>

                <p>If the <strong>same seed</strong> is used again, the algorithm will always produce the <strong>same
                        sequence</strong> of "random" values. This repeatability is a key characteristic of pseudorandom
                    number generators (PRNGs), and it's both a limitation and a powerful tool.</p>

                <p>For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>If a game uses seed <code>12345</code> to generate a procedurally created level, the layout of
                        that level will be identical every time the game is run with the same seed.</li>
                    <li>This makes it easy for developers to reproduce bugs, test features, or share exact scenarios
                        with players or colleagues.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>In summary, pseudorandomness behaves like a shuffled deck that always shuffles the same way when you
                    give it the same instructions—helpful in development, but important to manage carefully if you want
                    your randomness to <em>feel</em> organic to the player.</p>


                <h3 id="controlled-randomness" class="anchor">2. Controlled Randomness in Video Games</h3>
                <p>In game development, pure randomness is often avoided because it can lead to player frustration or
                    unbalanced experiences.
                    Instead, developers implement <strong>controlled randomness</strong>, a set of techniques that guide
                    or adjust random outcomes
                    to align with gameplay design goals.</p>
                <p>Some examples of this controlled randomness are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Loot Systems – Diablo, Overwatch:</strong> These games use a "biased randomness" or
                        "loot tables" to ensure
                        players are rewarded in a fair and predictable way over time. For example, after a certain
                        number of loot boxes, a rare
                        item is guaranteed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical Hits – XCOM Series:</strong> XCOM uses a system where missed shots increase the
                        hidden probability of future hits.
                        This system smooths out frustration when a player experiences repeated bad luck.</li>
                    <li><strong>Card Draw – Hearthstone:</strong> Cards are drawn randomly, but deck construction and
                        mulligan phases provide strategic
                        control over probabilities.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This approach to randomization has some advantages over true random generation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved Player Satisfaction:</strong> Controlled systems reduce the feeling of
                        unfairness. Players feel rewarded for
                        persistence rather than punished by luck.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gameplay Balance:</strong> Developers can fine-tune randomness to avoid extreme outcomes
                        that break difficulty curves or
                        progression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Replayability with Reliability:</strong> You can offer varied experiences while
                        maintaining structure and fairness.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>However, it also has some disadvantages that are evident in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Loss of Surprise:</strong> Over-controlled randomness can feel predictable or
                        manipulated, reducing the thrill of unexpected
                        outcomes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Implementation:</strong> Designing systems that feel fair and natural while
                        still using randomness requires extra
                        effort and testing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency Issues:</strong> If players notice the system is “rigged,” even in their
                        favor, it can break immersion or
                        trust.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It also includes several common challenges to be considered when designing and implementing systems
                    using this semi-random generation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Perceived Fairness vs. Actual Fairness:</strong> A mathematically fair system may still
                        feel unfair if players don't understand
                        the underlying mechanics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Random Fatigue:</strong> Too many outcomes left to chance can wear down player
                        motivation, especially in competitive settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balancing Consistency with Variety:</strong> Ensuring the game feels different each
                        time, without allowing luck to dominate
                        skill, is a constant balancing act.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Ultimately, controlled randomness is not about removing randomness, but about shaping it to serve the
                    player's experience. It’s a powerful
                    design tool when used intentionally and transparently.</p>


                <h3 id="practical-applications" class="anchor">3. Practical Applications of Randomness in Video Games
                </h3>
                <p>Randomness plays a crucial role in shaping gameplay across a wide variety of genres. Its applications
                    go far beyond just “rolling a dice”; it drives world generation, AI behavior, reward systems, and
                    even narrative outcomes—each with unique goals and challenges.</p>

                <p>One of the most recognizable uses is in <strong>Procedural Generation</strong>. Games like
                    <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Spelunky</em> generate their environments algorithmically, resulting in
                    unique worlds or levels for each playthrough. This randomness boosts replayability and gives players
                    a sense of discovery. However, ensuring these randomly generated spaces are still fun, balanced, and
                    navigable is a constant design challenge.
                </p>

                <p>Another important area is <strong>Enemy AI Behavior</strong>. Randomized elements—such as patrol
                    patterns or combat tactics—can make enemies feel less robotic and more realistic. In stealth games,
                    for
                    example, slightly unpredictable movement can increase tension. However, randomness in AI must be
                    handled carefully to avoid frustrating players with seemingly irrational or unfair decisions,
                    especially in strategic or competitive settings.</p>

                <p><strong>Loot and Reward Systems</strong> are perhaps the most commercially exploited form of
                    randomness. In games like <em>Borderlands</em> or <em>Destiny</em>, weapons and gear are generated
                    with randomized stats, encouraging players to keep searching for the “perfect drop.” While this
                    creates excitement and long-term engagement, it can also backfire if the odds feel unfair, or if
                    progression becomes overly reliant on chance. Gacha systems in mobile games are a notable
                    example: players are drawn in by the promise of rare characters or items, but the opacity of odds
                    often leads to controversy, especially when monetization is involved.</p>

                <p>Randomness is also used in more subtle ways, such as <strong>Puzzle and Event Variation</strong>.
                    Games like <em>Into the Breach</em> or <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> randomize enemy placements, events,
                    or character traits, ensuring that no two playthroughs feel exactly the same. This unpredictability
                    keeps gameplay fresh, but requires a safety net in design to avoid unsolvable scenarios or extreme
                    difficulty spikes.</p>

                <p>Even in narrative games, randomness finds its place. Titles like <em>Disco Elysium</em> use
                    randomized dice rolls for dialogue choices or skill checks, allowing story paths to branch in
                    unexpected and memorable ways. This adds a layer of spontaneity to storytelling, though it can be
                    tricky to ensure that each possible outcome still feels coherent and rewarding.</p>

                <p>In short, randomness in video games is a tool for generating variety, surprise, and player-driven
                    storytelling. When used thoughtfully, it transforms static systems into living worlds. But if left
                    unchecked or poorly implemented, it can just as easily undermine the player's sense of control and
                    satisfaction.</p>


                <h3 id="how-to-apply" class="anchor">4. How to Properly Apply Randomness in Development</h3>
                <p>Applying randomness in game development isn't just about calling a random function and hoping for the
                    best. It's about aligning random systems with your design goals—whether that’s creating suspense,
                    balancing difficulty, or increasing replay value. Properly implemented randomness enhances player
                    engagement without making them feel like they’re at the mercy of pure chance.</p>

                <p>One key concept is the use of <strong>probability distributions</strong>. While uniform randomness
                    (where every outcome has equal probability) is easy to implement, it’s rarely the best choice for
                    game feel. Instead, developers often use distributions like the <em>normal (bell curve)</em> to
                    generate more predictable but still variable outcomes, or <em>Poisson distributions</em> to model
                    rare events like critical hits or loot drops.</p>

                <p>Let’s say you want to design a random critical hit system that feels fair over time. A simple way to
                    do this is with a “pity counter,” which increases the chance of a critical hit every time one fails.
                    Here’s how that might look in pseudocode:</p>

                    <img src="./Resources/rng/rngCode.png" alt="loot-box"
                    class="blog-image">

                <p>This technique is simple but effective. It prevents long streaks of failure while keeping the
                    excitement of a sudden success. You can tune the base chance and increase factor depending on how
                    generous or punishing you want the system to be.</p>

                <p>It’s also important to <strong>test and iterate</strong>. Randomness needs balance: too much can feel
                    chaotic, too little can feel repetitive. Tools like heatmaps, player telemetry, or simple logging
                    can help you visualize how your random systems behave over many runs or sessions.</p>

                <p>Lastly, always consider <strong>player perception</strong>. Even mathematically sound randomness can
                    feel unfair if players don’t understand what’s happening behind the scenes. Sometimes it’s worth
                    making odds slightly more forgiving than they seem—or communicating mechanics more transparently—to
                    keep players satisfied.</p>

                <p>In the end, randomness should feel like magic, not math. The goal is to surprise players, not confuse
                    or punish them.</p>


                <hr class="right-hr">
                <p id="conclusion">
                    In conclusion, randomness is far more than a background mechanic; it's a fundamental part of how
                    games create emotion, tension, and variety. From procedural generation to AI unpredictability and reward systems,
                    its influence is everywhere. But effective randomness doesn't come from chaos; it comes from design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When randomness is implemented with intention and balance, it enhances gameplay and keeps players
                    engaged. But when it's left unchecked or poorly communicated, it can feel unfair, frustrating, or even manipulative.
                    The difference lies in control, context, and player perception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a developer, understanding randomness is not just about generating numbers, it's about shaping
                    experiences. Whether you're designing a loot system, a level generator, or an encounter mechanic, your job is to
                    ensure that what feels random is, in fact, thoughtfully crafted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So next time a player gets that perfect critical hit, uncovers a hidden cave, or opens a rare item
                    drop, just remember: behind that moment of surprise, there’s a whole system working silently to make it feel
                    just right.
                </p>
